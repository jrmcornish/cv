%   % I completed a DPhil in machine learning at the University of Oxford as part of the AIMS CDT, with a focus on Bayesian statistics and deep learning. I hold first-class honours degrees in electrical engineering and in pure mathematics from the University of Melbourne, and in applied mathematics from Monash University. In all these I received various prizes for academic excellence. I am a passionate entrepreneur who believes in the potential of technology to bring about positive societal changes at a large scale.

\cvsect{Technical skills}

% Even within the context of academic research,
I believe it is important to be as familiar as possible with low-level, practical details of current and emerging technologies. %, since there are many problems that only become visible at this level.
% I have a proven track record of quickly adapting to new technologies at all layers of abstraction in order to achieve the requirements of a given project.
To this end, I have completed large-scale projects involving each of the following:
