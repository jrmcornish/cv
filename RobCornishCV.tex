%       I have a background in machine learning, mathematics and statistics, and electrical engineering, and am currently employed as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford.
%       I wish to pursue a career in science, applying mathematical and statistical techniques rigorously to solve interesting problems and to impact the world in a postive way.
%       % I am particularly drawn to CNRS given the significant intellectual freedom it offers, and the open-minded culture of free inquiry that it provides.

%     % I have a background in machine learning, mathematics and statistics, and electrical engineering, and recently completed a DPhil at the University of Oxford working on techniques for properly quantifying uncertainty in very large-scale machine learning models.
%     % I am a co-founder of Quro Medical, a digital health startup pioneering technology-enabled hospital-at-home services in Southern Africa.
%     % Quro has provided me with an incredibly rewarding opportunity to apply my technical knowledge in a context where the potential for positive impact is immediate.
%     % The COVID-19 pandemic in particular has seen us rapidly scale up our offering to respond to the increased demand for high-quality remote care and monitoring services in order to relieve pressure on hospitals.
%     % Alongside this, I have been working as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford, investigating machine learning techniques for healthcare applications that I hope to apply to the work we are doing at Quro Medical in the near future.}

% %   {\bf MODIFY}
%   % I completed a DPhil in machine learning at the University of Oxford as part of the AIMS CDT, with a focus on Bayesian statistics and deep learning. I hold first-class honours degrees in electrical engineering and in pure mathematics from the University of Melbourne, and in applied mathematics from Monash University. In all these I received various prizes for academic excellence. I am a passionate entrepreneur who believes in the potential of technology to bring about positive societal changes at a large scale.

        {Quro Medical}
        {Quro Medical is a South African digital health startup pioneering technology-enabled remote patient monitoring and hospital-at-home services in Southern Africa.
        Quro has successfully treated large numbers of patients with a variety of medical conditions, including many with COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic, and successfully raised multiple rounds of funding. See \underline{\href{https://www.quromedical.co.za}{www.quromedical.co.za}} or our feature on \underline{\href{https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/south-africas-quro-medical-comes-out-of-stealth-with-1-1m-to-expand-its-hospital-at-home-service/}{TechCrunch}}.

        I was the only technical cofounder.
        Some of my contributions included: building the initial version of the platform, including Android, cloud, and front-end components (much of which is still in use today); hiring a team of developers to take over this work; and convincing potential investors and other stakeholders of the technical viability and promise of our overall strategy.}

\cvsect{Technical skills}

Even within the context of academic research, I believe it is important to be as familiar as possible with low-level, practical details of current and emerging technologies. %, since there are many problems that only become visible at this level.
% I have a proven track record of quickly adapting to new technologies at all layers of abstraction in order to achieve the requirements of a given project.
To this end, I have completed large-scale projects involving each of the following:
