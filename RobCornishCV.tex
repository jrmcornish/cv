%       I have a background in machine learning, mathematics and statistics, and electrical engineering, and am currently employed as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford.
%       I wish to pursue a career in science, applying mathematical and statistical techniques rigorously to solve interesting problems and to impact the world in a postive way.
%       % I am particularly drawn to CNRS given the significant intellectual freedom it offers, and the open-minded culture of free inquiry that it provides.

%     % I have a background in machine learning, mathematics and statistics, and electrical engineering, and recently completed a DPhil at the University of Oxford working on techniques for properly quantifying uncertainty in very large-scale machine learning models.
%     % I am a co-founder of Quro Medical, a digital health startup pioneering technology-enabled hospital-at-home services in Southern Africa.
%     % Quro has provided me with an incredibly rewarding opportunity to apply my technical knowledge in a context where the potential for positive impact is immediate.
%     % The COVID-19 pandemic in particular has seen us rapidly scale up our offering to respond to the increased demand for high-quality remote care and monitoring services in order to relieve pressure on hospitals.
%     % Alongside this, I have been working as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford, investigating machine learning techniques for healthcare applications that I hope to apply to the work we are doing at Quro Medical in the near future.}

% %   {\bf MODIFY}
%   % I completed a DPhil in machine learning at the University of Oxford as part of the AIMS CDT, with a focus on Bayesian statistics and deep learning. I hold first-class honours degrees in electrical engineering and in pure mathematics from the University of Melbourne, and in applied mathematics from Monash University. In all these I received various prizes for academic excellence. I am a passionate entrepreneur who believes in the potential of technology to bring about positive societal changes at a large scale.
