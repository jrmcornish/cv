\noindent
To whom it may concern,

\noindent
I am writing to apply for your 2019 PhD internship program. I believe that working and
interacting with the community at Deepmind would be a unique opportunity to broaden my
research perspective. I would be very excited about the chance to do so.

\noindent
I have broad research interests and have worked on several topics in Bayesian machine
learning. My CV contains a complete list of my publications. I have also attached a letter
of recommendation from my supervisor, Prof. Arnaud Doucet, which includes some details of
the work we have been doing on scalable MCMC.

\noindent
Please don't hesitate to contact me to discuss any aspect of my application at greater
length. I hope to hear from you soon.

\noindent
Regards,

\noindent
Rob Cornish
