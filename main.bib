  abstract  = {We explore a transformational approach to the problem 
		of verifying simple array-manipulating programs.  
		Traditionally, verification of such programs requires 
		intricate analysis machinery to reason with universally
		quantified statements about symbolic array segments, 
		such as ``every data item stored in the segment A[i] 
		to A[j] is equal to the corresponding item stored in the
		segment B[i] to B[j].'' We define a simple abstract 
		machine which allows for set-valued variables and we 
		show how to translate programs with array operations to
		array-free code for this machine.  For the purpose of 
		program analysis, the translated program remains faithful
		to the semantics of array manipulation.  Based on our 
		implementation in LLVM, we evaluate the approach with
		respect to its ability to extract useful invariants and 
		the cost in terms of code size.}
